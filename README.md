# TASK-3

Linear Regression Analysis
A comprehensive implementation of simple and multiple linear regression using Python for house price prediction. This project demonstrates fundamental machine learning concepts including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Features:

Simple Linear Regression: Predicts house prices based on area alone
* Multiple Linear Regression: Uses area, bedrooms, and stories for improved predictions
* Model Evaluation: Comprehensive metrics including MAE, MSE, and R² score
* Data Visualization: Regression plots, residual analysis, and feature importance charts
* Coefficient Interpretation: Clear explanations of model parameters and their real-world meaning

Technologies Used:

* Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* Dataset: Housing price data with features like area, bedrooms, and stories
* Machine Learning: Linear regression algorithms with train-test split validation

Key Outcomes:

* Implemented both simple and multiple linear regression models
* Achieved R² scores showing model performance and variance explanation
* Provided actionable insights through coefficient interpretation
* Created comprehensive visualizations for model understanding

Perfect for learning regression fundamentals and understanding how different features impact house prices.
